## IPFS Integration

IPFS is used to store encrypted files. To integrate with IPFS, you need the `ipfshttpclient` library to interact with a local or public IPFS node.

### Upload File

```python
import ipfshttpclient

def upload_file_to_ipfs(file_path):
    client = ipfshttpclient.connect('/dns/localhost/tcp/5001/http')  # Connect to local IPFS node
    res = client.add(file_path)
    return res['Hash']  # Return file hash
```
