## Introduction

This application allows for secure and anonymous file sharing using encryption, IPFS for file storage, and Tor for ensuring anonymity. It provides users with tools for encrypting files before uploading them to a distributed storage system. 

The project consists of several components:
- **Encryption**: AES for file encryption and RSA for digital signatures.
- **Storage**: IPFS for distributed file storage.
- **Anonymity**: Tor for hiding user identity.

## Features of the Project

- **AES Encryption**: Protects files using modern symmetric encryption.
- **IPFS Storage**: Files are stored in a distributed network, eliminating reliance on central servers.
- **RSA Digital Signatures**: Ensures file integrity.
- **Anonymity via Tor**: Uses Tor network to conceal the user's identity during file upload.
